/**
 * This ruleset enforces a security model for an E-Learning Recommendation System.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: The security model is based on strict user ownership and roles. Most
 * user-specific data is private. An 'admin' role is introduced for content management.
 * Publicly accessible data, like the course catalog, is read-only for clients, but
 * writable by admins.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Contains private user profile data. Can contain an 'isAdmin' and 'isDisabled' flag.
 * - /ratings/{ratingId}: Contains individual user ratings.
 * - /courses/{courseId}: The public course catalog. Writable only by admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Role: A user document with `isAdmin: true` grants write access to the /courses collection
 *   and specific management rights over the /users collection.
 * - User Isolation: Users can only interact with their own data tree under /users/{userId},
 *   with the exception of admins performing specific management tasks.
 * - Limited User Listing: Only admins are allowed to list documents in the /users collection.
 * - Public Read-Only Catalog: The /courses collection is publicly readable by any signed-in user.
 * - Disabled Users: Users with `isDisabled: true` are blocked from all write operations.
