/**
 * This ruleset enforces a security model for an E-Learning Recommendation System.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: The security model is based on strict user ownership. All user-specific
 * data, such as profiles and course ratings, is private and can only be accessed by the
 * authenticated owner. Publicly accessible data, like the course catalog, is segregated
 * into its own top-level collection and is read-only for clients.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Contains private user profile data. Each document is owned by the
 *   user corresponding to the {userId}.
 * - /ratings/{ratingId}: A top-level collection containing individual user ratings.
 *   This structure facilitates backend aggregation without exposing user data.
 * - /courses/{courseId}: A top-level collection of all available courses, intended for
 *   public read access.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: Users can only interact with their own data tree under /users/{userId}.
 *   They cannot read, list, or modify any other user's information.
 * - No User Listing: Listing all documents in the top-level /users collection is explicitly
 *   disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Public Read-Only Catalog: The /courses collection is publicly readable by anyone,
 *   including unauthenticated users, to allow browsing.
 * - Client-Side Rating Submission: Authenticated users can create ratings in the /ratings
 *   collection, but cannot read the entire collection or modify existing ratings.
 * - Path-Based Security: Ownership is determined by the {userId} in the document path or
 *   document data, which provides a fast and secure way to grant access.
